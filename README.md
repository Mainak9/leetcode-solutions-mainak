Problem integer-to-roman.py : https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/
Description : Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.
Example:
Input: num = 3749
Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"
Explanation:
3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
